\label{sec:xgrid:Testing}
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Several tests have been added to the structure to elucidate the process of external file reading for
exchange grids. Additional verbosity has been added to the following alternative tests: AltXGridUtest,
 XGridOffUtest, and TimeStepUTest. AltGridCreateUTest has been updated as well in the Grid tests.

An example .stdout is provided here:

Here, compared to the base XGridUTest, each read and process step is printed. This ensures accuracy
of the input files being read as well as the additional validation of each sub-step. Additionally, the
flux conservation here

Here, the same validation printouts are provided as before. In further detail, the errors provided
are computed as percent error. Error values above the threshold set in the test will fail the test.
